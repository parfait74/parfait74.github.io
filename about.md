### What about Parfait74?

Young professional in the middle ages who is currently signed up for a bachelor degree in computer science at
Linn√© University.
This is meant to be achieved along with his 125% daily work as a Solution Architect at CSC Sweden.
Thankfully he has that under control, or at least producing papers with squares and arrows saying TCP/IP!

Reason for taking this direction with school seems to be that he is more or less focused on infrastructure and
now want's to have a go with the softer part as well, at least in a more structured way.

When Parfait74 has some spare time he enjoys being outdoors. It could be hiking, fishing or hunting. The autumn is a
very hectic time for this figure. He did practice golf before as well, but that has taken a back-seat position for the
moment.

Strangely enough he seems to attract the other sex. There is a female accompanying him at his apartment that lies 
in the eastern part of this kingdom.
Parfait74 originates from beyond the highest mountains from the north of Sweden.

In his home Parfait74 thrives. Here he has his computers, guitars, drums, keyboard and XBONE. Since food is an important
part of his life (must be since he has a degree in cooking as well) he has started an interest in wines.

### Where does he find the time????
