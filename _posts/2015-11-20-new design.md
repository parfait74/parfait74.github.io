# Reminder to self!

Start from scratch next time, it's a nightmare trying to troubleshoot code someone else
has written. Still got a small glitch when changing between pages, seems the wrapper is off somehow.
Still, do like how you can use liquid automate things for you.

Did how ever change some text-color, header got a new look and footer as well.
Even got a small logo made in svg in!

Should be doing some labs and examinations instead, as usual :)
