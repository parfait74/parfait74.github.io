# STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!

When you have multiple projects at work with tight deadlines and a couple of
examinations due in school. Shouldn't you make the time to focus on that?

NO!
I go and buy [Fallout 4][fallout-home] on my XBONE.

Not my best moment, but hey! it definitely let me forget about work, school and
everything else needed to be done around here.
Good thing I have an understanding fiancee :)
